<p> Computer science, the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer science includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information processes, and artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics and engineering and therefore incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and electronic circuit design. Computer science also makes heavy use of hypothesis testing and experimentation during the conceptualization, design, measurement, and refinement of new algorithms, information structures, and computer architectures. It is considered as part of a family of five separate yet interrelated disciplines: computer engineering, computer science, information systems, information technology, and software engineering. This family has come to be known collectively as the discipline of computing.

<p> English is the most popular and well-known Human Language. The English language has its own set of grammar rules, which has to be followed to write in the English language correctly.
Likewise, any other Human Languages (German, Spanish, Russian, etc.) are made of several elements like nouns, adjective, adverbs, propositions, and conjunctions, etc. So, just like English, Spanish or other human languages, programming languages are also made of different elements.
Just like human languages, programming languages also follow grammar called syntax. There are certain basic program code elements which are common for all the programming languages. Multiple programming languages can help you solve the same programming problem. However, you need to select a language that you feel is relevant to perform your task. If you decide that a language does not suit your business requirement, you can always move on to a new language. Your skill in the chosen language will also be a deciding factor. Expected software system response time, a number of simultaneous users, security, maintains, compatibility with web, mobile, devices are few other factors to consider while choosing a language.
